# Bio
I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in [Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at [Duke](https://duke.edu), and I'm funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.asee.org/).  I work in the intersection of machine learning and healthcare under the supervision of [Katherine Heller](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~kheller/). Before that, I obtained my AB in Mathematics (2013) from Dartmouth College, and wrote an honors thesis under the supervision of Daniel Rockmore.

My email address is ``jdf38@duke.edu``.
